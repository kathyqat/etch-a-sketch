# etch-a-sketch

This project is for building a browser version of an Etch-A-Sketch. From The Odin Project's (TOP) [Full Stack Development](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project) course.

I'm confused as to why TOP stressed that this is a difficult project, when all of the concepts have been seen in previous assigned work. The previous Rock Paper Scissors project showed how to add JS interactivity to buttons and how to work with window prompts. The assigned JS Drum Kit challenge demonstrated how to iterate through elements and attach event listeners and edit classes. I especially found JS Drum Kit to be more difficult than this Etch-A-Sketch.

Thought during process: I was going to remove the class 'hover' for each div, but I thought it would be cleaner code if I didn't keep re-assigning the squares nodelist.
